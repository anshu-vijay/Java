## Take your first steps towards cloud with AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Deploy REST APIs, Full Stack Applications, Web Applications and Containers to the cloud.

Spring Boot is the No 1 Java Framework to develop REST API and Microservices. AWS (Amazon Web Services) is the No 1 Cloud Service Provider today.

How about learning AWS by deploying Spring Applications to Cloud using Elastic Beanstalk?

## Course Overview

In this course, we deploy a variety of Spring Boot Applications to the Cloud:
- REST APIs - Hello World and Todo - Jar
- Todo Web Application War
- Full Stack Application with React and Spring Boot
- Single Container with REST API
- Multi Container with Todo REST API talking to MySQL

This course would be a perfect first step as an introduction to AWS and the Cloud.

You will learn about automating deployments with Elastic Beanstalk CLI and creating a continuous delivery pipeline with AWS Code Pipeline. You will learn how to Auto Scale applications based on load as well as deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer using Elastic Beanstalk.

You will be using a number of AWS Services - EC2, S3, AWS CodePipeLine, AWS CodeBuild, SQS, IAM, CloudWatch. 

You will be using deploying a variety of projects to Amazon Web Services (AWS). These projects are created with  React (Frontend Framework), Spring Boot (REST API Framework), Spring (Dependency Management), Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization - Basic and JWT), BootStrap (Styling Pages), Maven (dependencies management), Node (npm), Visual Studio Code (TypeScript IDE), Eclipse (Java IDE) and Tomcat Embedded Web Server. We will help you set up each one of these.
